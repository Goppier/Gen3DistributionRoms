# Gen3DistributionRoms

Every distribution rom available in this post is made from the Aurora Ticket, however there are different versions depending on the game you want to use them with (FRLG is for FireRed and LeafGreen versions, and EMER is for Emerald version.). They'll have their each "Now Sending" messages to prevent confusion. However please note that you can't use Emerald's Aurora Ticket distribution on FireRed and LeafGreen versions... even though that would be exciting!

FireRed and LeafGreen:
- Aurora Ticket
- Mystic Ticket
- Altering Cave
- All 6 Wish Egg Pokémon (Chansey, Drowzee, Exeggcute, Farfetch'd, Kangaskhan, and Lickitung)

Emerald:
- Aurora Ticket
- Mystic Ticket
- Altering Cave
- Old Sea Map
- Eon Ticket

Details about the Scripts and Wonder Cards:
As we worked on this project, we carefully decided how and if we were going to release this at all. However we ultimately made the decision that if we were going to release this, we needed more than just a watermark to prove it was custom. So we made the difficult choice to rework the wonder cards (aligning the text to make them all uniform), as well as using debug scripts found within the game to achieve the same result of obtaining the event items... just without using unpreserved event rom data. Lastly about the wish eggs, unfortunately the community hasn't been able to find the distribution rom, or the scripts alongside the wonder card... so we had to use the Pokémon Egg Gift (extended) script made by Suloku! The original rom for the wish eggs had a randomization function that as of this post hasn't been recreated, so we decided to still include all 6 separately in their own roms.

Equipment Required:
- 2x GBA's
- 2x GBA Wireless Adapters
- 1x Flash Cart (like EZ-Flash or Everdrive)
- 1x English Language Emerald, FireRed or LeafGreen cartridge
